The main purpose of code in this directory is to

1) process the sea ice concentration data daily from NASA Team to first compute sea ice extent in the subpopulation domain regions  (extenttotals_nt.m)

2) and then process the extents to compute first and last days of the ice-free seasons,
and IFD for each subpopulation, which is the number of ice-free days each year
(compute_firstday_lastday_nt.m)

The results are compiled into the table in IFDbyregion.csv

To reproduce this table is involved but everything you need should be in this directory, once you've downloaded the data NASA Team data from NSIDC

All intermediate output of scripts is provided here
