The main purpose of code in this directory is to

1) process the sea ice concentration data daily from NASA Team to first compute sea ice extent in the subpopulation domain regions  (extenttotals_nt.m)

2) and then process the extents to compute first and last days of the ice-free seasons,
and IFD for each subpopulation, which is the number of ice-free days each year
(compute_firstday_lastday_nt.m)
